## Introduction

The sinking of the RMS Titanic in April 1912 remains one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history. Out of the approximately 2,224 passengers and crew members aboard, more than 1,500 lost their lives when the ship struck an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City (Encyclopaedia Britannica., 2024).The tragedy not only marked a significant moment in maritime history but also revealed stark differences in survival rates among passengers based on their socio-economic status, age, gender, and class (Lord, 2005)

In the age of data science and machine learning, the Titanic dataset has become a widely used benchmark for learning and applying classification algorithms (Titanic, 2024).It offers a rich mix of categorical and numerical data, and allows for exploratory data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling. By leveraging data-driven techniques, we can uncover patterns and relationships in the dataset that may have influenced the survival of passengers.

This project uses a subset of the Titanic passenger data to explore how different machine learning algorithms perform in predicting survival. We focus on three commonly used classification techniques—Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree—to develop models that estimate the probability of a passenger surviving the disaster. Each method offers unique strengths: logistic regression provides a probabilistic framework; KNN offers simplicity and intuitive logic; and decision trees bring interpretability and structure (James et al., 2013).

Beyond just model accuracy, this project aims to provide insights into the predictive power of various features and examine how well these algorithms generalize on unseen data. The findings can also demonstrate the potential and limitations of different algorithms when applied to real-world classification problems.
